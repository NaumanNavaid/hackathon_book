# Chapter 07 : Physics Simulations for Robotics

## Introduction

Physics simulation forms the backbone of modern robotics testing and development, enabling virtual prototypes to behave according to real-world physical laws. In robotics, physics engines provide the computational framework for simulating object interactions, dynamics, and environmental constraints that govern robot behavior.

:::info
Physics simulation in robotics differs from game physics in its emphasis on accuracy and predictability. While games prioritize visual appeal and performance, robotics simulations require precise physical modeling for reliable algorithm development and testing.

## 7.1 Physics Engine Fundamentals

### 7.1.1 Introduction to Physics Simulation

A physics engine is a software component that provides an approximate simulation of certain physical systems, such as rigid body dynamics (including collision detection), soft body dynamics, and fluid dynamics.

### 7.1.2 Core Physics Components

A comprehensive physics simulation system consists of several interconnected components:

#### Rigid Body Dynamics
Rigid body dynamics govern the motion of solid objects that do not deform under stress. The fundamental equations of motion for rigid bodies are:

```text
Equation of Motion:
M * dv/dt = F_ext + F_contact

Where:
M = Mass matrix (including inertia tensor)
v = Velocity vector (linear and angular)
F_ext = External forces (gravity, user-applied forces)
F_contact = Contact and constraint forces
