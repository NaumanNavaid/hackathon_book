# Chapter 06 : Unity for Robotics Visualization

## Introduction

Unity has evolved from a game engine into a premier platform for robotics simulation and visualization ("Sim2Real"). Unlike traditional simulators like Gazebo, which prioritize physics accuracy over visuals, Unity offers **photorealistic rendering**, **advanced physics (NVIDIA PhysX)**, and **cross-platform deployment** (VR, AR, Mobile). This chapter explores how to build "Digital Twins" that look and act like their real-world counterparts.

**Why Unity?** While Gazebo is excellent for testing algorithms, Unity is superior for **Computer Vision** training (due to HDRP rendering) and **Human-Robot Interaction** (due to XR support).
