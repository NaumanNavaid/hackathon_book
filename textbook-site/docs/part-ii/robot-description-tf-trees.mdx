# Chapter 05 : URDF, Robot Description, TF Trees

## Introduction

Robot description is a fundamental aspect of robotics that enables visualization, simulation, and control of robotic systems. The Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) provides a standardized way to define robot geometry, kinematics, and dynamics. Combined with the Transform (TF) library, it creates a powerful system for managing coordinate relationships in complex robotic systems. This chapter covers the complete pipeline from robot modeling to coordinate management.

:::info
URDF and TF form the backbone of ROS 2 robotics. Mastering these concepts is essential for anyone working with robotic systems, as they provide the foundation for everything from simulation to real-world robot control.

## 5.1 URDF Fundamentals

### 5.1.1 URDF Structure and Components

URDF uses XML to describe robot models with links (rigid bodies) and joints (connections between links):
