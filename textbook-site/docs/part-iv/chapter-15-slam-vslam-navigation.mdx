# Chapter 13 : SLAM, VSLAM, and Navigation

## Introduction

Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is one of the fundamental challenges in robotics. The robot must build a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously estimating its position within that map.

:::info
SLAM addresses the chicken-and-egg problem: to build a map, you need to know your position; to know your position, you need a map. The solution lies in the probabilistic framework that estimates both pose and map simultaneously while maintaining uncertainty estimates.

## 13.1 SLAM Fundamentals

### 13.1.1 The SLAM Problem

SLAM can be formulated as a Bayesian estimation problem.

**SLAM Equation:**

```text
p(x_1:t, m | z_1:t, u_1:t) = eta * p(z_t | x_t, m) * Integral [ p(x_t | x_t-1, u_t) * p(x_1:t-1, m | z_1:t-1, u_1:t-1) ]

Where:
x_1:t = Robot poses over time
m     = Map (landmarks or occupancy grid)
z_1:t = Measurements over time
u_1:t = Controls over time
